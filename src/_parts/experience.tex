%
% automatic patch generation tool
%
\begin{project}{Patch Generation Framework}{\texttt{Python}}
\item Created, maintained a tool to help a client base of 5000 Bloomberg developers run our refactoring tool offerings
\item Integrated with internal code indexing service to generate on-demand patches from various refactoring presets
\item Automated the end-to-end refactoring workflow for clients to ensure productivity and reduce review fatigue
\end{project}

%
% uncommon
%
\begin{project}{C\texttt{++} Legacy Code Migration Tool}{\texttt{C++, LLVM/Clang LibTooling}}
\item Maintained a Clang LibTooling-based tool to replace pointers to shared memory with equivalent function calls
\item Added features such as static bounds checking and redundant include deletion
\item Exposed critical bugs and misuses in a refactoring effort affecting $\approx 2000$ legacy projects
\end{project}

%
% code brainiac
%
\begin{project}{Service for Source Code Intelligence \& Indexing}{\texttt{Flask, Python}}
\item Created a pair of RESTful services to store, and retrieve projects and their metadata 
\item Designed an API specification for queries on the metadata associated with these projects
\item Enabled periodic, background analysis of the entirety of our code base of roughly 13000 projects
\end{project}

%
% trace-includes
%
\begin{project}{C\texttt{++} Header Dependency Tracer}{\texttt{C++}}
\item Optimized a tool that parses the \texttt{\#include} statements in a C/C\texttt{++} source file to list header dependencies
\item Cached results by file path to reduce I/O, achieved speed-up of $\approx2\times$
\item Used \href{https://perf.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Main_Page}{\texttt{perf}} to profile tool performance, and reduced the number of \texttt{open} syscalls, achieved speed-up of $\approx6\times$
\item Achieved performance match with \texttt{gcc, clang} for a single file, speeding up linearly in the size of bulk queries
\end{project}

%
% unimangler
%
\begin{project}{Cross Platform Symbol Demangler}{\texttt{Flex, C++, LLVM/Clang LibTooling}}
\item Created a tool from scratch to parse mangled C\texttt{++} names from various from non-linux compilers like: \texttt{xlC, SunStudio}
\item Reverse engineered patterns in mangled name generated by target compiler into a \texttt{flex} grammar
\item Created a comprehensive test suite to document the grammar's properties
\item Used in a large-scale structured code search project to index all of the code base of 13000 projects
\end{project}

%
% ldscript
%
\begin{project}{GNU Linker Script Parser}{\texttt{ANTLR4, Python}}
\item Created a parser using ANTLR4 for \href{https://sourceware.org/binutils/docs/ld/Scripts.html}{GNU Linker Scripts} to aid in parsing and tracking transitive link-line dependencies
\item Used as a base component by tools that validate and fix linker dependency information of every C/C\texttt{++} project
\end{project}

\begin{workEx}{University of Florida}{May 2017 -- Dec 2017}{Research Intern}{Gainesville, FL}
\begin{project}{Automatic Terrain Identification}{\texttt{C++, CUDA, gprof}}
\item Responsible for accelerating part of the MPI code base with CUDA kernels
\item Achieved speed-up for 200$\times$, reducing run-time from 65min to 20sec
\end{project}
\end{workEx}
